    My favorite part of playing games is those "Aha!" moments when something clicks. I've tried lots of games because those moments come more
    often when you're just starting. But before you can enjoy learning cool concepts, you have to get past the initial wall:
</p>
<blockquote>"What am I even supposed to do?"</blockquote>
<p>
    This site helps beginners get over that wall, enjoy discovering the game, and learn in the best order with carefully selected resources
    &mdash even for those approaching intermediate level.

    Shoutout to my dad's site,
    <a href="https://professionalexplainer.com/pe_main_page.html">Professional Explainer</a>.
    I inherited his love of learning things, and combined it with my mom's love of games.
